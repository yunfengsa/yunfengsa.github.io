# classic-martinb

A simple Octopress theme. I made some edits to the original classic theme to slim it down a little and add different navigation links. It also includes [font-awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/). You can load any of its icons by simply pasting the HTML for an icon into the desired HTML file.

## Installation

```shell
$ cd octopress
$ git submodule add git://github.com/martinbjeldbak/classic-martinb.git .themes/classic-martinb
$ rake install['classic-martinb']
$ rake generate
```

If using zsh, there might by globbing issues running `$ rake install['classic-martinb']`, running `$ rake "install[classic-martinb]"` might be required.

## Caveats
To get social icons for LinkedIn and Facebook, add the variables ``facebook_user`` and ``linkedin_user`` with corresponding values to your ``_config.yml`` file, as per PR [martinbjeldbak/classic-martinb#2](https://github.com/martinbjeldbak/classic-martinb/pull/2).
